<p>
  Ale is a type of beer brewed using a warm fermentation method, resulting in a sweet, full-bodied and fruity taste.[1][2] Historically, the term referred to a drink brewed without hops.[3]

As with most beers, ale typically has a bittering agent to balance the sweetness of the malt and act as a preservative. Ale was originally bittered with gruit, a mixture of herbs or spices boiled in the wort before fermentation. Later, hops replaced gruit as the bittering agent.  </p>
